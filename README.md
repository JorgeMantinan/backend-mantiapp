# backend-mantiapp

<h2>Introduction</h2>
> This project was created for study and learn more about Spring.
<br> I decided to create a <b>Real Estate Website</b> to help my brother with his job. For this reason 
<b>I prioritized the functional parts</b> and have stopped doing the validations and error handling for the end, 
since it is with a <b>0 $ budget</b> and the <b>client (my brother)</b> can ask me anything at any time.
<h2>Code information</h2>
> This code has:
<ul>
<li>Oauth2 Authentication</li>
<li>Roles service</li>
<li>Login service</li>
<li>List of ownerships</li>
<li>Create, update and delete of ownerships</li>
</ul>
<br>
The base of develop is with Java, <b>Spring Boot</br>
